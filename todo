switch from printing to returning a string !! we need another iterator for printing ( to handle the case of the errors come first and then the output)
handle also the formatting ;)
handle the . and .. missing when -a -> Done
handle the -l when having a symbolic link ;)  -> Done
-a is set we must sort the entries 
coloring is a must  -> needed when tty
-F -> Done but not integred 
handle the (commands put on file instead of a directory) -> Done 
// we need to colorize the output if and only if istty()  ;)
// we need to edit the impl iterator again and see if we can return 2 iterators (one of the valid targets and the ther for errors) done 
// the print also needs more way of handling (we need to find the max of each field and then format ) done  
// need to know more about hiw

// to test things out here's the path  :   ../../../../dev 

// there is a minor and major for the char and the block files done 
// there is a problem in the time
// there is a t and s (that need to be handled for the the execute)
//  implements the display trait for the vec<PathBuf>  done 









///////////////////////////

case ->   ls -l /bin
case -> when adding the suffixes they must follow the target til having the correct type
