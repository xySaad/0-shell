switch from printing to returning a string !! we need another iterator for printing ( to handle the case of the errors come first and then the output)
handle also the formatting ;)
handle the . and .. missing when -a -> Done
handle the -l when having a symbolic link ;)  -> Done
-a is set we must sort the entries 
coloring is a must  -> needed when tty
-F -> Done but not integred 
handle the (commands put on file instead of a directory) -> Done
