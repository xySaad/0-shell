switch from printing to returning a string !! we need another iterator for printing ( to handle the case of the errors come first and then the output)
handle also the formatting ;)
handle the . and .. missing when -a 
handle the -l when having a symbolic link ;) 
-a is set we must sort the entries 
coloring is a must  
-F
